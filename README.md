# Last-Human
A precision platformer inspired by [Celeste](https://www.google.com/search?q=Celeste&rlz=1C1VDKB_en-GBAU991AU991&oq=Celeste&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59l2j0i271l2.946j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Written in C++ with the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) graphics library and [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for UI Rendering. Unfortunately this project was never finished but rather served as a learning experience.
