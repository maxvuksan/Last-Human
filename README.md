# Last-Human
A precision platformer set in a city reclaimed by nature. Written in C++ with the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) graphics library and [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for UI Rendering. Unfortunately this project was never finished but rather served as a learning experience.
